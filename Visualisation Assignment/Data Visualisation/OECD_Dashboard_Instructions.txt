# OECD Patent Data Dashboard - User Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for running and using the interactive dashboard implemented in `Chart.py`.

## 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
- Required Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `dash`, `plotly`.
- The following files should be in the same directory:
  - `Chart.py`
  - `OECD.STI.PIE,DSD_PATENTS@DF_PATENTS,1.0+.A...PRIORITY...INVENTOR..._T.csv`
  - `assets/custom.css` (for custom styling)

## 2. Installation of Required Packages
Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```
pip install pandas numpy dash plotly
```

## 3. Running the Dashboard
In the terminal, run:

```
python Chart.py
```

- The script will preprocess the CSV data and launch a local Dash server.
- After a few seconds, a message will appear with a local URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`).
- Open this URL in your web browser to access the dashboard.

## 4. Dashboard Features
- **Country Selection:** Use the dropdown to select a country. The charts will update accordingly.
- **Year Selection:** Use the checkboxes to select one or both years (2020, 2021). Multiple selections are supported.
- **Pie Chart:** Shows the percentage of patents by patent office for the selected country and years.
- **Column Chart:** Shows the number of patents by year and patent office, with bars grouped side-by-side for easy comparison.
- **Interactivity:** Hover over chart elements for tooltips. Changing selections updates both charts.

## 5. Customization
- To change the dashboard's appearance, edit `assets/custom.css`.
- To modify data preprocessing or chart logic, edit `Chart.py`.

## 6. Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, ensure you have installed all required packages.
- If the dashboard does not appear, check the terminal for error messages.
- For any issues with the data, ensure the CSV file is present and not corrupted.

## 7. Stopping the Dashboard
- To stop the dashboard, return to the terminal and press `Ctrl+C`.
